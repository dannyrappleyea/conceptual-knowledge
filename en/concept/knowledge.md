# Summary
Knowledge is a broad concept that encompasses the understanding, awareness, or familiarity gained through experience or education. It represents the collection of facts, information, descriptions, or skills acquired through the intellectual processes of learning, discovery, or understanding. Knowledge can be theoretical or practical, and it can be categorized in various ways, such as explicit, tacit, procedural, or declarative.

Explicit knowledge is information that can be easily articulated, written down, and shared with others. It includes facts, theories, and skills that one can communicate and teach, such as the steps in a mathematical proof, historical dates, or the grammar rules of a language. This type of knowledge is often found in books, databases, and documents and can be transferred through formal education or structured training programs.

Tacit knowledge, on the other hand, is more personal and harder to express. It involves intuitions, insights, and hunches that are often developed through personal experience and informal learning. It includes the know-how and expertise that people acquire on the job, such as a craftsman's skill in woodworking or a musician's ability to play an instrument. Tacit knowledge is often shared through mentorship, observation, and social interactions.

Procedural knowledge refers to the know-how involved in performing certain tasks. It's the knowledge of how to do something, like riding a bike or playing a game. This type of knowledge is typically acquired through practice and repetition, and it often becomes so ingrained that the actions are performed almost automatically.

Declarative knowledge, also known as propositional knowledge, is the knowledge of facts or things. It encompasses information that can be stated or declared, such as "Paris is the capital of France" or "Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level." This kind of knowledge is often what is tested in academic settings and is usually the starting point for further inquiry and exploration.

In a broader philosophical context, discussions about knowledge often revolve around epistemology, the branch of philosophy concerned with the nature and scope of knowledge. Key questions in epistemology include: What is knowledge? How is it acquired? What do people know? How do we know what we know? Philosophers have proposed various theories to address these questions, such as empiricism, which emphasizes the role of experience and evidence; rationalism, which stresses the role of reason and innate ideas; and constructivism, which suggests that knowledge is constructed by individuals as they engage with the world around them.

Knowledge is also distinguished by its levels of certainty and evidence. Justified true belief is a traditional model in epistemology that defines knowledge as a belief that is both true and justified by sufficient evidence or reasoning. However, this definition has been subject to debate and refinement over time.

In summary, knowledge is a multifaceted concept that encompasses various types of information, understanding, skills, and awareness gained through different means. It is a fundamental aspect of human culture, society, and individual consciousness, playing a crucial role in our ability to navigate and make sense of the world.
