# Summary
The word "of" is a versatile preposition that can be used to show membership or belonging to a particular category or group. When used in this context, "of" indicates that something is a part of a larger whole or falls within a specific category. For example, in the phrase "a book of poems," the word "of" signifies that the book contains poems and is therefore a member of the category of poetry books.

Similarly, in the phrase "a citizen of the United States," the word "of" indicates that the person belongs to the category of individuals who are citizens of the United States. This usage of "of" helps to specify the relationship between the subject and the larger category or group to which it belongs.

In essence, the word "of" is used to denote inclusion, possession, or association with a particular category, group, or set. By using "of" in this way, speakers can clarify the nature of the relationship between different elements in a sentence and indicate that something is a member or part of a specific category or group.
